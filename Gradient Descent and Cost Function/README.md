## Gradient Descent and Cost Function

* Among different lines(slopes), how do we know which one is the best suited.
* Using a error distance function which is the sum of distances of the points from the slope. 
* The one with the least sum is the answer

**Gradient Descent Algorithm here helps in finding the best fit line or slope for the given training daat set in less number of iterations.**
