## K Means Clustering Algorithm

Used in unsupervised learning where the dataset doesn't include target values or the feature labels.

Here, we are trying to determine the underlining structure or find the clusters in the data so as to make useful predictions.

### Determining the value of K

> Refer Elbow Technique

### Imports

> ```sklearn.cluster.KMeans```

> ```km = KMeans(n_clusters=3)``` forms 3 clusters

### Scale the data

> ```sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler```
