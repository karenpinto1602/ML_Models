## Random Forest Algorithm
Just as Forest has trees, there are trees here similar to the concepts learned in Decision Tree.

Random Forest divides the dataset into more than one to form multiple decision trees.

Finally, all the decision trees are made to predict the output, the value with the majority of the votes is declared as the result. 

### Imports
> ```sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier```

> ensemble is the term/library used when multiple algorithms are used to predict the outcome.

> ```n_estimators:n(integer)``` parameter means that there are n decision trees used
