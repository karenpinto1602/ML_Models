## Naive Bayes Classifier Algorithm
Called Naive because here naive assumptions are made that the features are independed of each other.

### Probability
> P(A/B) = Probability of event A knowing that event B has already occured

> Thomar Bayes conditional probability equation states <br />
 **P(A/B) = [P(B/A)*P(A)] / [P(B)]**
