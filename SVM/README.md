## Support Vector Machine

SVM draws a hyper plane in n-dimensional space such that it maximizes the margin between classification groups

### Imports
> ```sklearn.svm.SVC```


*We can try changing few paprameters in the SVC to alter the accuracy*

### To get a list of all parameters
> ```model.get_params(deep=True)```
