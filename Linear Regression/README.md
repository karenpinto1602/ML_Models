## 1. Predicting Home Prices using Linear Regression Single Variable.

| Area | Price  |
| ---- | ------ |
| 2600 | 550000 |
| 3000 | 565000 |
| 3200 | 610000 |
| 3600 | 680000 |
| 4000 | 725000 |

**Task 1: Predict prices with area 3300 square feet.**

### Approach

> Produce a Scatter plot, then draw a line (slope) which best fits the data points.
  
### Which line formed is best suited

> The line which gives the least summation of error(RMS) distance of all points from the line.
    
### Working

> slope(y) = mx + b\
> price = m * area + b
