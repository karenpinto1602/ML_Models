## Logistic Regression or Classification(Binary/Multi)

Prediction Results or Values are either continous or categorical.

1. **Linear Regression** helps predict continous values like in Home prices, weather or stock prices.
2. **Classification Methods** predicts categorical results like whether an email is spam or not, will a customer buy life insurance or which party is a person going to vote for.

### *Logistic Regression is one of the techniques used for classification*

### Classification Types
* Binary Classification: Spam/Not Spam, Yes/No.
* Multiclass Classification: More than 2 choices. Which party is a perosn going to vote?

### Logistic Regression uses sigmoid function to plot the line(S shape function)

where e = Euler's number ~ 2.71828
<br/>
So, basically the Sigmoid function converts input into a range 0 to 1.
